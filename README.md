# ThetaSweepModelling
Computational models for theta sweeps and theta phase precession in spatial tuning cells.

This repository contains code and resources for simulating and analyzing theta sweeps and theta phase precession in spatial tuning cells, such as head direction cell, place cells and grid cells. 

### Details of use

TBD

### The models are based on the following publications:

#### theta sweeps in  place cells:
