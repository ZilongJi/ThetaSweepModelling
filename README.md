# ThetaSweepModelling

Computational models for theta sweeps and theta phase precession in spatial tuning cells.

This repository contains code and resources for simulating and analyzing theta sweeps and theta phase precession in spatial tuning cells, such as head direction cells, place cells, and grid cells.

### Installation

The package is not yet published to PyPI, so install it from source after cloning the repository:

```bash
pip install -e .
# or
uv pip install -e .
```

Add the `".[dev]"` extra if you also want the local testing and linting tools (`pytest`, `ruff`).
